## 📝 2. Project Proposal

### 2.1 Title of the Project

[I-COURT : ONLINE SPORT FACILITY BOOKING SYSTEM]

### 2.2 Introduction to the Proposed Web Application

Sports facilities such as courts and training areas play an essential role in supporting physical development, recreational activities and community engagement within the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). As the demand for these facilities continues to grow among students, staff and nearby communities, the need for an efficient and accessible reservation system has become increasingly important.

	Currently, facility bookings at the Male Sports Complex (MSC) and Female Sports Complex (FSC) are often managed manually or through non-centralized methods, which can lead to miscommunication, inaccurate scheduling and unnecessary delays. To address these challenges, this project proposes the development of I-COURT, a centralized web-based booking system designed to streamline the reservation process for all MSC and FSC facilities.

	The I-COURT system aims to provide a convenient, real-time and user-friendly platform that supports transparent facility availability, secure bookings and better management oversight. By digitalizing the entire reservation process, the system enhances administrative efficiency while improving user accessibility across the IIUM community.

### 2.3 Objective of the Proposed Web Application

* **Objective 1:** To digitalize and centralize the booking process for MSC and FSC facilities through a user-friendly web platform.
* **Objective 2:** To provide real-time availability updates to prevent double bookings and ensure accurate scheduling.
* **Objective 3:** To improve accessibility for users that enabling students, staff, and nearby communities to make bookings anytime and anywhere.
* **Objective 4:** To create a structured and transparent booking environment that supports fair use of sports facilities and reduces communication gaps between users and administrators.
